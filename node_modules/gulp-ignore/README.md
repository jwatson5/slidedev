gulp-ignore
===========

plugin for [gulp](https://github.com/wearefractal/gulp) to ignore files in the stream based on file characteristics

Note
----

`gulp.src()` now supports multiple globs including ignore globs.  See [glob-stream](https://github.com/wearefractal/glob-stream).  In most cases, this is sufficient, removing the need for this plugin.

```javascript
gulp.task('kill-js', function() {
  gulp.src(['./**/*.js','!./node_modules/**','!./libs/**'])
    .pipe(something());
});
```

Usage
-----

options arg has 3 optional properties: {
  isFile:true, // ignore files
  isDirectory:true, // ignore directories
  pattern:'glob' // minimatch glob: string or array of strings, or a function that returns the answer to 'ignore this?'
}

```javascript
var ignore = require('gulp-ignore');

gulp.task('kill-js', function() {
  gulp.src('./**/*.js')
    .pipe(ignore({pattern:['./node_modules/**','./libs/**']}))
    .pipe(something());
});

gulp.task('kill-css', function() {
  gulp.src('./**/*.css')
    .pipe(ignore({isFile:true}))
    .pipe(something());
});
```
